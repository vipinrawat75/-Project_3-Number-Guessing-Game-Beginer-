# 🎯 Number Guessing Game in Python

This is a simple command-line based Number Guessing Game built with Python.  
The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it.

## 🕹️ How the Game Works

- The computer picks a random number from 1 to 100.
- The player is asked to guess the number.
- After each guess, the program provides feedback:
  - 📉 Too Low
  - 📈 Too High
- The game continues until the correct number is guessed.
- Invalid (non-numeric) inputs are handled gracefully.
- The total number of attempts is displayed at the end.
